# Maya python tools
Python tools for Maya.

## lockit.py and unlockit.py
Simple scripts for the shelf to lock and unlock the translation, rotation and scale of selected objects.
Motivation: useful for reference objects

## manualBackup.py
Simple script to save a backup copy of current file. Equivalent to save as followed by renaming back to original file name.
Motivation: For small, experimental projects, incremental save creates too many files with trivial changes.
